Hybrid Mult-cloud networking is a real life issue that complicates at scale. Additionally, with the introduction of IaC and legacy on-prem networking, Aviatrix solves a large problem statement; How do I scale my multi hybrid cloud infrastructure securely while retaining the benefits of an on prem network. 

I am currently a Cloud Solutions Architect and a Senior Systems Engineer at Nutanix. Nutanix is the Enteprise Cloud Company. 
Networking is a fundamental issue that many face when moving from an on-prem network into a flat cloud network. 

My preparation was a three pronged approach, available below here. I have taken many certifications in IT over the last 15 years. One thing I am very cautious of is the certification process with new vendors/alliances. An AWS Solutions Architect exam is much different than a Nutanix NCP-MCI exam vs HashiCorp. Certifications from VMware and Nutanix are antiquated and rely on what buttons i push in what order on what OS and what version of software. Much different than an ACE Associate or Professional exam. Before putting in the time and resources - make sure you know how the exam is proctored so you can study in an effective manner. 

1. Use the Aviatrix study track here --> https://aviatrix.teachable.com/ . I highly recommend completing the entire module program. In addition, there are resources from the Aviatrix community site that are very helpful. At this time the ACE track includes enrollment in the preperation course followed by a certification exam that is remote. At this time in March 2021 there is a free exam voucher vallid through April 30, 2021 --> ACEMULTICLOUD 

2. Always looks for others who passed the exam and the help and insight they provide; https://mayankchourasia2.medium.com/how-did-i-passed-the-aviatrix-ace-aviatrix-certified-engineer-multi-cloud-networking-associate-d1315855aa45 I used this online blog to help understand the materials used in preperation. 

3. There is nothing wrong with exam dumps. They allow you to peak at the structure of the proctor and ideally gives you tools needed to prepare based on the flow and questions of the certification. I used a free preview mode so I could see the format of questions beign asked. My advice - just Google until you find a preview dump and get your hands on 2-3 questions.
